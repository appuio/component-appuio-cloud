= Policy: `organization-projects`

[abstract]
Ensure that all OpenShift Projects created by users have a label `appuio.io/organization` which isn't empty.

[horizontal]
Category:: Namespace Ownership
Minimum Kyverno version:: v1
Subject:: APPUiO Organizations
Policy types:: `mutate`
Implementation:: https://github.com/appuio/component-appuio-cloud/tree/master/component/namespace-policies.jsonnet[component/namespace-policies.jsonnet]

This policy will:

- Check that each project created by a user without cluster-admin  permissions has a label appuio.io/organization which isn't empty.
- Check that the creating user is in the organization they try to create a project for.

The user's organization membership is checked by:

- Reading the project's annotation `openshift.io/requester` which contains the username of the user who originally requested the project.
- Fetching all OpenShift groups
- Reading the `appuio.io/organization` label of the request and finding a group with the same name

If a group matching the label value exists, the policy checks that the user which requested the project is a member of that group.

If the label `appuio.io/organization` is missing or empty or the user isn't a member of the group, the request is denied.
