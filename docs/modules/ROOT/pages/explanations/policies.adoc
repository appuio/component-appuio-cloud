= Policies

[abstract]
This documentation explains how the different policies interact to implement the requirements and architectural decisions for APPUiO Cloud.

== Namespace ownership

The architecture for namespace ownership is documented in https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/architecture/namespace-ownership.html["kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud > Architecture > Namespace Ownership"]

Most of the Kyverno policies managed by the component implement an aspect of namespace ownership.

There's three main aspects to consider when implementing namespace ownership for APPUiO Cloud:

* Users should be able to https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/ns-arbitrary-name.html[create arbitrary namespaces directly with `kubectl create`].
* Users should be able to https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/create-ns-with-oc-new-project.html[create arbitrary namespaces through OpenShift's Project mechanism], either on the web console or with `oc new-project`.
* Any namespace created by a regular user must be https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/functional/namespace-organization.html[associated with an organization for billing purposes].

Additionally, the policies dealing with namespace ownership need to consider the following APPUiO Cloud requirements:

* A single organization can only https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/performance/ns-quota.html[create a limited number of namespaces] on an APPUiO Cloud zone.
* Users should be able to https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/create-ns-with-serviceaccount.html[use serviceaccount tokens to create namespaces] belonging to the same organization to which the serviceaccount belongs.
* Users should be able to https://TODO[modify selected annotations and labels on namespaces] belonging to their organization(s).
* By default, https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/ns-organization-rbac.html[the namespace's organization is granted role `admin`] in the namespace.

=== Implementation

*TODO: flow chart for namespace policies*

=== Policies which are executed for all requests by unprivileged principals

The following policies are executed for all namespaces which are created by an unprivileged principal:

xref:references/policies/02_disallow_reserved_namespaces.adoc[`disallow-reserved-namespaces`]::
This policy ensures that users can't create namespaces which match a pattern which is reserved for the system.
We need this policy to ensure that users can't adversely impact the system by using namespace names which might be used by the system in the future.
Effectively, this is a restriction of the requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/ns-arbitrary-name.html[users can choose arbitrary namespace names] to ensure overall system availability.
The component allows operators to configure the set of disallowed patterns.

xref:references/policies/02_validate_namespace_metadata.adoc[`validate-namespace-metadata`]::
This policy ensures that users can only create or edit selected labels and annotations.
We want to allow users to transfer namespace ownership between organizations of which they're members.
Transferring a namespace boils down to changing the namespaces `appuio.io/organization` label to the organization which should receive ownership of the namespace.
Since we need to ensure that users can't transfer namespaces to organizations to which they don't belong, we need to validate any mutations of namespace labels and annotations.
Additionally, we need to ensure that users can't modify arbitrary labels or annotations on a namespaces, since OpenShift exposes a number of privileged operations (such as setting a namespace-wide node selector for workloads) as labels and annotations on namespace objects.
+
TIP: This policy is executed when namespaces are created or updated.

xref:references/policies/12_namespace_quota_per_zone.adoc[`check-namespace-quota`]::
This policy denies creation of new namespaces for an organization which has used up their namespace quota on a zone.
The component allows operators to adjust the global and per-organization namespace quota.
+
This policy implements the requirement that a single organization can only https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/performance/ns-quota.html[create a limited number of namespaces] on an APPUiO Cloud zone.

xref:references/policies/10_generate_default_rolebinding_in_ns.adoc[`default-rolebinding-in-ns`]::
This policy grants role `admin` to the organization to which the new namespace belongs.
+
This policy implements the requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/ns-organization-rbac.html[the namespace's organization is granted role `admin`].


xref:references/policies/11_generate_quota_limit_range_in_ns.adoc[`quota-and-limit-range-in-ns`]::
This policy generates default `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` objects in all namespaces belonging to an organization.
The policy allows cluster operators to adjust the generated objects by adding appropriate annotations to namespaces.
+
This policy implements the requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/performance/resource-quota.html[the APPUiO Cloud zone is protected from abusive resource usage] for resource types which can be managed through Kubernetes `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` objects.
Notably, we deploy a quota limiting the cumulative memory and CPU https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[resource requests and limits] of all containers per namespace and a quota limiting the count of other Resources, such as `Service` and `Secret` objects, per namespace..

=== Policies which are executed for requests to create a Namespace by specific unprivileged principals

We handle actual validation of namespace creation by users and by ServiceAccounts in different policies:

xref:references/policies/02_organization_namespaces.adoc[`organization-namespaces`]::
This policy is executed when a namespace is created by a user.
The policy denies the request if the user tries to create a namespace for an organization which they're not a member of, or when a user who doesn't have a default organization assigned tries to create a namespace without an explicit organization.
If the user creates a namespace without an explicit `appuio.io/organization` label, their default organization is set as the value of the label.
+
This policy implements the requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/ns-arbitrary-name.html[create arbitrary namespaces directly with `kubectl create`]
Additionally, this policy ensures that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/functional/namespace-organization.html[user namespaces are associated with an organization for billing purposes] for those namespaces.

xref:references/policies/02_organization_sa_namespaces.adoc[`organization-sa-namespaces`]::
This policy is executed when a namespace is created by a ServiceAccount.
The policy looks up the ServiceAccount's organization by looking up the organization to which the ServiceAccount's namespace belongs.
The policy denies the request if the ServiceAccount tries to create a namespace for a different organization than the one to which it belongs.
If the ServiceAccount creates a namespace without an explicit `appuio.io/organization` label, it's organization is set as the value of the label.
+
This policy implements the requirement that users should be able to https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/create-ns-with-serviceaccount.html[use serviceaccount tokens to create namespaces].
Additionally, this policy ensures that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/functional/namespace-organization.html[user namespaces are associated with an organization for billing purposes] for namespaces created by ServiceAccounts.

=== Policies which are executed for requests to create a ProjectRequest resource

xref:references/policies/03_projectrequest.adoc[`organization-in-projectrequests`]::
This policy is executed when a user creates a `ProjectRequest` either with `oc new-project` or through the OpenShift webconsole.
The policy checks whether the user has a default organization and denies the request if they don't.
+
This policy implements the requirement that users can https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/usability/create-ns-with-oc-new-project.html[create arbitrary namespaces through OpenShift's Project mechanism].

=== Policies which are executed for requests to create a Project resource

xref:references/policies/02_organization_projects.adoc[`organization-projects`]::
This policy is executed when the control plane creates a `Project` resource based on a `ProjectRequest` created by a user.
The policy reads the annotation `openshift.io/requester` on the `Project` and uses the value of that annotation to lookup the user which requested the project.
The user's default organization is then injected as label `appuio.io/organization` on the `Project` resourcefootnote:[
On OpenShift whenever a `Project` is created, the control plane automatically creates a `Namespace` in the background.
Labels added on a `Project` by the policy are applied to the `Namespace` as well, ensuring that any projects created by a user belong to that user's default organization.
].
+
This policy ensures the requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/functional/namespace-organization.html[user namespaces are associated with an organization for billing purposes] for namespaces created through an OpenShift project.

== Policies which don't interact with organization namespaces

The component also manages a number of Kyverno policies which implement other features than namespace ownership on APPUiO Cloud zones.

xref:references/policies/30_set_runonce_activedeadlineseconds.adoc[`set-runonce-activedeadlineseconds`]::
This policy injects a default value for `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` for run-once pods which don't have an explicit value for that field.
The policy which validates mutations of annotations on namespaces allows users to override the default value which is injected for individual namespaces by annotating the namespace.
+
This policy implements the linked requirement for pods which only run oncefootnote:[
Usually, those are pods created by Kubernetes jobs or cronjobs.
However, the policy also affects pods created directly without a controller, for example by applying a Pod manifest to the cluster.
].
This policy implements requirement that https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/performance/resource-quota.html[the APPUiO Cloud zone is protected from abusive resource usage] to protect the cluster from run once pods with unbounded runtime.
